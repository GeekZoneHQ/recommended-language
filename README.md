# Inclusive Naming Initiative Recommended Language List
This is purely a JSON dictionary of discouraged names and their alternatives; [recommended-language.json](recommended-language.json). It can be used to generate human-readable documentation as well as machine automations such as GitHub actions.

This repo is the primary source of truth so that the list,
- can be updated without having to update the code.
- is always up to date.
- is always complete.
- can be contributed to by anyone via PRs.
